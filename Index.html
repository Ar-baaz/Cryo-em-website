                <h2>CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY</h2>
                <p>Cryo-EM, short for cryo-electron microscopy, is a powerful imaging technique used in structural biology to visualize the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules at high resolution. It has revolutionized the field by providing detailed insights into the architecture of complex biological systems.</p>
                <p>In cryo-EM, samples are rapidly frozen in a thin layer of vitreous ice, preserving their native structure. The frozen sample is then placed in an electron microscope, where it is bombarded with a beam of electrons. The electrons interact with the sample, and their resulting scattering patterns are captured by a detector.</p>
                <p>These scattered electron patterns contain valuable information about the structure of the sample. By collecting a large number of these patterns from different orientations, a three-dimensional reconstruction of the sample can be generated using sophisticated computational algorithms.</p>
                <p>Cryo-EM has proven to be instrumental in elucidating the structures of challenging biological macromolecules such as large proteins, protein complexes, viruses, and membrane proteins. It has contributed to numerous breakthroughs in understanding biological processes and has facilitated drug discovery efforts by providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of diseases.</p>
                <p>The technique has its advantages over other structural biology methods, such as X-ray crystallography, which often requires obtaining high-quality crystals of the molecule of interest. Cryo-EM can work with smaller sample sizes and can image molecules in their more natural, flexible states.</p>
